## 👤 Avatar System

### Current State

- Basic 3D character silhouettes on stage
- Lip sync tied to audio output

### Expansion Ideas

#### Visual Customization

- [ ] Character body types (tall, short, round, lanky)
- [ ] Facial features and expressions
- [ ] Clothing/costume options
- [ ] Signature props (scientist's beaker, comedian's mic)

#### Animation States

- [ ] Idle animations per personality (fidgeting, pacing, zen)
- [ ] Reaction animations (laugh, gasp, eye-roll, facepalm)
- [ ] Entry/exit animations
- [ ] "Thinking" animation while LLM generates

#### Voice-Driven Features

- [ ] Emotion detection from text → facial expression
- [ ] Gesture sync (hand movements during emphasis)
- [ ] Posture shifts based on conversation dynamics

#### Avatar Presets

Create distinct visual identities for each character archetype:

| Character | Visual Style | Signature Move |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| The Comedian | Bright colors, casual clothes | Jazz hands, bouncing |
| The Philosopher | Muted tones, tweed jacket | Chin stroke, slow nod |
| The Scientist | Lab coat, glasses | Pushes glasses up, points |

## 🔊 Audio Enhancements

- [ ] Per-character voice style presets
- [ ] Background ambiance (cafe, stage, office)
- [ ] Applause/laugh track for comedy moments
- [ ] Sound effects for mode transitions

---

## 🎬 Director AI Improvements

- [ ] More sophisticated scene analysis
- [ ] Callback detection (bring back earlier jokes)
- [ ] Tension/pacing management
- [ ] "And scene!" auto-detection for natural endings

---

## 📱 Platform & Sharing

### Text-Only Replay System

> **Key Insight:** We only need to store the text transcript! TTS can re-render speech on playback, which opens up powerful post-production possibilities:

- [ ] Store scene transcripts (agent ID + text per turn)
- [ ] Re-render with different voice styles
- [ ] Swap avatars/scenes/backgrounds on replay
- [ ] Add props, effects, or alternate music
- [ ] "Director's Cut" mode with different pacing

### Sharing Features

- [ ] Export scene as video/audio
- [ ] Share clips to social media
- [ ] Save favorite scenes
- [ ] Replay with different characters

---

## 🧪 Experimental Ideas

- **Audience Participation**: Let viewers vote on topics mid-scene
- **Multi-User**: Multiple humans can join as characters
- **Learn Mode**: AI learns user's humor style over time
- **Character Creator**: Design custom agents with personality sliders
